def findPrimeFactorsOptimized(n):
    """
    Finds and prints the prime factors of a given number n.

    This function optimizes the process by only iterating up to the square root of n.
    For each factor found, it continuously divides n by that factor until n is no longer divisible.
    The remaining n is either 1 or a prime number, which is appended to the result.

    Args:
        n (int): The integer whose prime factors are to be found.

    Returns:
        None: The function prints the list of prime factors.

    Example:
        findPrimeFactorsOptimized(450)
        Output: [2, 3, 3, 5, 5]
