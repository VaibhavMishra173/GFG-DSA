This track of the course covers the basics of "Bitwise Algorithms". 

Binary Representation: We'll look at the binary representation of numbers .
Set and Unset: We'll learn to set and unset the bits
Toggling: We'll toggle the bits.
Bitwise Operators: We'll use AND, OR, XOR, NOT, LShift, and RSHIFT operators.
Algorithms: We'll get familiar with various bitwise algorithms that'll make problem solving easy.


This is the first part of the Bitwise Operators in C++ which introduces us to the first 3 of the 6 bitwise operators in C++, namely:

AND (&) operator
OR (|) operator
XOR (^) operator

This is the second part of the Bitwise Operators in C++ which introduces us to the last 3 of the 6 bitwise operators in C++, namely:

Left Shift Operator (<<)
Right Shift Operator (>>)
Bitwise Not operator
